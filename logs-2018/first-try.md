# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day
3. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
6. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))

## Log

### Day 1: January 21, Sunday

**Today's progress**: Advance in two chapters of Prealgebra. Read a chapter of Fundamentals of C++ Programming and code two exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day, although I didn't have a lot of time I managed to complete at least a chapter of the book. Surely, I've things to improve like get to work first before think about social media or anything else. But after all, things went well.

### Day 2: January 23, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Read chapter 4 of Pre Algebra and Fundamentals of C++ Programming. Reach level 6 of Portuguese.

**Thoughts**: Was a hard day, I had too little time and have to spend it mostly in what was importantly. Unfortunately I didn't code more than the examples on the book.

### Day 3: January 24, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Finally started the HTML/CSS book from Shay Howe. Practice Portuguese and also finished college homework.

**Thoughts**: Right now, I'm so tired. Was a very hard day, with many unfortunately incidents but I was able to do code and learn a little.

### Day 4: January 25, Thursday

**Today's progress**: Read and make a test from the Shay Howe book "Learn to code HTML and CSS". Keep calm (?)

**Thoughts**: I thought yesterday was a hard day, but this was even worse. A family member became ill (yesterday) and right now my anxiety levels are in spike. It's a very difficult moment, I hope to.. well.

### Day 5: January 26, Friday

**Today's progress**: Learn more about Fractions (multiplication, division and simplification) and pass one more lesson in the HTML/CSS book.

**Thoughts**: I feel I'm slowly progressing, thought I have to be careful about my gaps in knowledge. I'm thinking to code more in the morning, after just waking up due to lack of time.

### Day 6: January 30, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Practiced a lot of C++ classes for college.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't code last days, because my grandfather passed away on Saturday. I really couldn't focus. Now I'm better and recovering my progress.

### Day 7: January 31, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Practiced static stacks and queues in C++.

**Thoughts**: I didn't learn a lot because all the things I did today was more like a review. I feel like I haven't improved, but I'm okay with that. Slow is better than nothing.

### Day 8: February 1, Thursday

**Today's progress**: Level up in Duolingo's Portuguese course. Learn lessons 6 and 7 of HTML/CSS Shay's book.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't complete all the items for my today list, but it was awesome to learn more things today!. Also, I'm looking for fork the Style Conference miniproject, to make it somehow my "own project" and not only a tutorial.

### Day 9: February 3, Saturday

**Today's progress**: Learn lessons 8 and 9 of HTML/CSS Shay book, practiced fractions, solve a new algorithm exercise for college and learn/practice portuguese (as always).

**Thoughts**: Today was an incredible day, I knew I was capable to do more. I know tomorrow I'll complete the book, and also finish learning some new algorithms in c++.

### Day 10: February 4, Sunday

**Today's progress**: I finished HTML/CSS book from Shay Howe! I know it will serve as a catapult (?) to develop better pages. Also, I finished chapter 4 of Prealgebra.

**Thoughts**: I'm afraid I didn't had the progress I expected on Algorithms. Tomorrow will be my first test in college, I hope to pass it.

### Day 11: February 5, Monday

**Today's progress**: I pass my test on school. Barely

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately, I didn't coded today because 

**Links to work**:
None :(

### Day 12: February 6, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Today I wrote C++ templates for stacks and queues.

**Thoughts**: I don't have any particular thought about this day. I mean, it wasn't nor hard nor easy, just a regular task. These last two days were like that.

1. [Code repo](https://github.com/jesuodz/code/commit/ddfba932fe187d9ded02d65b8a834239cacb095d) _last commit_

### Day 13: February 7, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Add dequeue.cpp and its corresponding source.

**Thoughts**: I just can't understand how to code a linked list, or even how pointers are used but I had to deliver the code of a double-ended queue for college today. [This code](https://github.com/jesuodz/code/commit/0d68535bd77680520c316478d171c402f56ab58d) is not mine, and although I could have showed it in class (the professor allowed it), also I thought wouldn't be capable of explain it, so it's better to understantd before how all these things work and practice them.

### Day 14: February 8, Thursday

**Today's progress**: Complete one freeCodeCamp algorithm (Mutations) and fix the code of my Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: As some of my previous days, I didn't had enough time to code and so I try to keep late at night to match some of my goals.

### Day 15: February 10, Saturday

**Today's progress**: Finish the tribute page!

**Thoughts**: Yesterday was a very depressing day. In fact, since Monday all my days were depressing and I was struggling to keep the challege. Anyway, today I made it and completed my tribute page to the Paria peninsula (with the help of google translate, unfortunately).

### Day 16: February 11, Sunday

**Today's progress**: Read Algorithms and Flowcharts

**Thoughts**: I decided this day will be spended mostly organizing stuff and learning some others. 

**Links to work**:
None :(

### Day 17: February 12, Monday

**Today's progress**: Improve my git/github workflow, learn a bit of Vim, learn about pointers and linked lists, code a FCC challenge and math (decimals).

**Thoughts**: Today was a very productive day. I will always remember to never use master branch to commit new changes, and how useful are pointers (thought I still need to practice as I haven't used them in real algorithms).

### Day 18: February 13, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Continue learning math (from lesson 5.3 to 5.5) and code my first implementation of a linked list into a stack.

**Thoughts**: I'm so happy I finally implemented a linked list! with pointers! (obviously), I hope to make more progress in this aspect tomorrow.

### Day 19: February 14, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Code three free code camp challenges, deployed a website using surge.sh and cleaned up repositories

**Thoughts**: I did not do anything that I should have done today, but everything I should have done any other day. I mean, I cleaned all my repos and pushed their changes, used surge.sh to deploy the tribute page, but I didn't learn nor code any data struc. for college. Meh, still it's not a wasted day.

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
