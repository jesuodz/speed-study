# 2018 Study plans

The goal of this year is to have a deep understanding of Web development while building projects along the way, get a good foundation in Math, Algorithms and Data Structures, and enough preparation to get a job on the field.

This is study plan is based on the recommendations from the professor Matt Might from is blogpost [What every computer science major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/). But the plan itself is very personalized.

**NOTE**: The preparation, Math and Algorithms section can be (and _should_ be) do it during all year, alongside at least one item of other section. Example: one day you read College Algebra, YDKJS - Up & Going, CS50x and one algorithm from FreeCodeCamp. It shouldn't be always like that, it's all about the amount of time and effort which takes every item.

**ANOTHER NOTE**: Although I created/remixed this guide for me, be aware of my third person voice.
