# 2018 Study plans

The goal of this year is to have a deep understanding of Web development while building projects along the way, get a good foundation in Math, Algorithms and Data Structures, and an some grade of knowledge of Data Science and AI.

**NOTE**: The preparation, Math and Algorithms section can be (and _should_ be) do it during all year, alongside at least one item of other section. Example: one day you read College Algebra, YDKJS - Up & Going, CS50x and one algorithm from FreeCodeCamp. It shouldn't be always like that, it's all about the amount of time and effort which takes every item.
