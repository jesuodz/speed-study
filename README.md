# 2018 Study plan

The goal of this year is to have a deep understanding of Web development while building projects along the way, get a good foundation in Math, Algorithms and Data Structures, and enough preparation to get a job on the field. This is study plan is based on the recommendations from the professor Matt Might from is blogpost [What every computer science major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/). But the plan itself is very personalized.
