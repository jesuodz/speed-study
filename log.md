# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day
3. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
6. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))

## Log

### Day 1: January 21, Sunday

**Today's progress**: Advance in two chapters of Prealgebra. Read a chapter of Fundamentals of C++ Programming and code two exercises.

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day, although I didn't have a lot of time I managed to complete at least a chapter of the book. Surely, I've things to improve like get to work first before think about social media or anything else. But after all, things went well.

### Day 2: January 23, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Read chapter 4 of Pre Algebra and Fundamentals of C++ Programming. Reach level 6 of Portuguese.

**Thoughts**: Was a hard day, I had too little time and have to spend it mostly in what was importantly. Unfortunately I didn't code more than the examples on the book.

### Day 3: January 24, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Finally started the HTML/CSS course from Shay Howe. Practice Portuguese and also finished college homework.

**Thoughts**: Right now, I'm so tired. Was a very hard day, with many unfortunately incidents but I was able to do code and learn a little.

### Day 4: January 25, Thursday

**Today's progress**: Read and make a test from the Shay Howe course's "Learn to code HTML and CSS". Keep calm (?)

**Thoughts**: I thought yesterday was a hard day, but this was even worse. A family member became ill (yesterday) and right now my anxiety levels are in spike. It's a very difficult moment, I hope to.. well.

### Day 5: January 26, Friday

**Today's progress**: Learn more about Fractions (multiplication, division and simplification) and pass one more lesson in the HTML/CSS course.

**Thoughts**: I feel I'm slowly progressing, thought I have to be careful about my gaps in knowledge. I'm thinking to code more in the morning, after just waking up due to lack of time.

### Day 6: January 30, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: Practiced a lot of C++ classes for college.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't code last days, because my grandfather passed away on Saturday. I really couldn't focus. Now I'm better and recovering my progress.

### Day 7: January 31, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Practiced static stacks and queues in C++.

**Thoughts**: I didn't learn a lot because all the things I did today was more like a review. I feel like I haven't improved, but I'm okay with that. Slow is better than nothing.

### Day 8: February 1, Thursday

**Today's progress**: Level up in Duolingo's Portuguese course. Learn lessons 6 and 7 of HTML/CSS Shay Course.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't complete all the items for my today list, but it was awesome to learn more things today!. Also, I'm looking for fork the Style Conference miniproject, to make it somehow my "own project" and not only a tutorial.

### Day 9: February 3, Saturday

**Today's progress**: Learn lessons 8 and 9 of HTML/CSS Shay Course, practiced fractions, solve a new algorithm exercise for college and learn/practice portuguese (as always).

**Thoughts**: Today was an incredible day, I knew I was capable to do more. I know tomorrow I'll complete the course, and also finish learning some new algorithms in c++.

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
